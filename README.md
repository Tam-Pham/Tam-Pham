### Hello! I am Tam 👋

I'm currently a Psychology Research Assistant at Clinical Brain Lab (NTU), Singapore ✨ 👩‍🔬 

### About me

I love tearing my hair out everyday trying to recruit participants and re-assure them that wearing a cap full of gel 🧠 and being hooked up with wires 💓 is the coolest thing ever 😁😁😁 I also have strong interests in statistics and neurophysiological signal processing and I'm now spending most of my days contributing to one of the most awesome open-source packages on :octocat: -  [**NeuroKit2**](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project to delineate the neural correlates of deception 🤐
- 👯 I’m applying for Graduate Studies in Clinical Psychology, hoping to research further on Suicide, SIB and Affective Disorders.
- 🎾 When I'm not staring at my computer, you can find me at the tennis court hitting some balls 💥
